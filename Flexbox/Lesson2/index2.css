/*Part 1: The flexbox container has 2 axis a horizontal axis (Called the main axis)
and a vertical axis. (called the cross axis). The default is the horizontal
axis (left to right) as that is the typical way that people read, and
therefore is the most commonly needed direction. */

/*Part 2: There is a commented out section in the .container selector.
remove the comment brackets and this will change the direction of the main
axis in the flex container to be in the cross direction. This will affect
other flexbox properties later as you will see in further lessons. */
