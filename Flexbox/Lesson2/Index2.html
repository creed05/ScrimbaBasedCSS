      <!-- The first concept that is important in a flexbox is the idea of
       containers. You can set this up using a any element with any class.
       What is important is that the elemtents are direct children of the
       element. They will then become flexelements in the flexbox. You likely
       will be using many containers so you will want to come up with a naming
       convention to keep track of them.  -->
