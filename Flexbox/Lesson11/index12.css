/* Part 1: This time we are going to create a photo grid. While this would be
done better with a technique called CSSgrid that we will get to in a few
lessons, it is possible to do this with flexbox. Typically when deciding wether
to use flexbox or CSSgrid, you should use flexbox for 1 dimensional styling,
and CSS grid for 2 dimensional styling, and occassionally you should combine
them. */

/* part 2: The first thing to notice is that they are all in a straight line.
You can try wrapping them by adding a flex-wrap: wrap; to the container, but
now they are just in a vertical line, because they are too big. So the first
thing that we are going to want to do is control the size of the images.  */

/* Part 3: No the grid should work and it will change as you resize the page.
One thing that will be unwanted is the changing size of the grid as you change
window width. To prevent this uncomment out part 4. What this does is it gives
item a base width but otherwise allows them to grow and shrink as needed to fill
the grid. */
